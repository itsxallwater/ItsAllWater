      Hello! My name is Mike Wright and this is It's All Water, LLC. We're a
      one-man shop offering freelance software development based out of Phoenix,
      AZ. You are probably thinking "that's a strange name for a software
      development company" and you're not wrong! Inspiration for the name comes
      from one of my favorite sayings, "it's all water under the bridge". When I
      was registering this LLC in 2015, it felt like a natural (and unique)
      name. Alas, that does mean we do not offer any services related to
      H2O&mdash;<i>at least not yet</i>!

      since late 2018. While I came on as a Senior Software Developer, by
      January of 2020 I became Director of Technology. My work with Zumasys
      primarily consists of directing the Product Support, Internal Development
      and Internal Helpdesk/IT groups. I also co-chair Product Development and
      am a general open source evangelist for the organization (I am super
      passionate about the

      VS Code extension). Every now and then I'm known to help in executing on
      contract development work for clients across a variety of domains and
      technical stacks, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ol class="lead">
      <li>Vue.js</li>
      <li>Javascript & Typescript</li>
      <li>PickBASIC (jBASE, OpenQM, D3, UniVerse)</li>
      <li>ASP.NET Core</li>
      <li>C#</li>
      <li>Java</li>
    </ol>

      Prior to joining Zumasys I spent the first thirteen years of my career
      (re: my whole career) at a timeshare servicing company based in
      Scottsdale. Though I no longer work there, I'm extremely appreciative of
      the opportunities that were provided to me. My experience there allowed me
      to grow as a developer across several technology stacks:
    </p>
    <ol class="lead">
      <li>PickBASIC (D3 and jBASE)</li>
      <li>ColdFusion</li>
      <li>Microsoft SQL (T-SQL, SSRS and SSIS)</li>
      <li>ASP.NET (WebForms)</li>
      <li>C#</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="lead">
      Not only did I gain valuable technology experience, I also became familiar
      with Office 365 for Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, PCI DSS Compliance (Level
      1), HIPAA Compliance and SSAE-18 audits. Due to the fact it was a smaller
      company, I was able to chart my own course and take a strong sense of
      ownership and pride in my work. Not to mention, I established great
      friendships with many individuals that will never fade away. That time has
      led me to the present, where I'm excited to bring those skills to help out
      anyone in need!

      Outside of providing freelance software development, I'm a husband to an
      amazing woman and father to an equally amazing son. I'm also a huge sports
      fan, supporting all of the local professional teams plus Arizona State.
      When I'm not hanging with the family or watching games, you're likely to
      find me coding, running, cycling or enjoying the great culinary and
      brewery scenes of Phoenix! If you're reading this wanting more, you'll
